# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

![Project Logo]("") <!-- Add a logo or banner image for visual appeal -->

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** to agriculture to enhance **crop yield prediction** and **optimize resource usage**. By analyzing historical data, the model can forecast future crop performance and assist farmers in making informed decisions. Additionally, it features a **recommender system** to suggest the best time for using fertilizers, improving productivity.

### Key Highlights:
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts crop yields based on historical data.
- **Fertilizer Recommendations**: Offers insights on optimal fertilizer usage timing.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Empowers farmers to make better, smarter decisions.
- **Real-Time Crop Monitoring**: Tracks crop performance for better resource management.

## 🚜 Usage

1. **Upload Historical Data**: Upload your region's crop data for analysis.
2. **View Predictions**: The model will predict the yield and suggest the best fertilizer application times.
3. **Monitor Crops**: Use real-time analysis to make smarter decisions throughout the farming process.

## 📊 Example Dataset

The project uses historical crop data from various regions to train the prediction model. Here is a sample of the dataset:

| Year | Region  | Crop   | Area (hectares) | Production (tons) |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 2020 | Region1 | Wheat  | 1500            | 3000              |
| 2021 | Region1 | Wheat  | 1600            | 3200              |

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The **Random Forest** algorithm is used to predict crop yield based on historical data, considering factors like:
- Weather conditions
- Soil type
- Fertilizer usage
- Crop type

You can also plug in new data or modify the model in the `models/` directory.

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- **Integration with IoT devices** for real-time soil monitoring.
- **Expanded dataset support** for more crops and regions.
- **Mobile app development** to make the system accessible on-the-go.
